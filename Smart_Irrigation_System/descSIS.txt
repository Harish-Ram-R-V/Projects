SMART_IRRIGATION_SYSTEM
  
      ðŸ’ A Smart Irrigation System automatically waters plants based on real-time soil moisture levels and environmental conditions like temperature or sunlight. 
      It conserves water, reduces manual labor, and is perfect for agriculture or home gardening automation.

HOW TO MAKE?
        I have used soil moisture sensore to measure the humidity in soil through resistance & conductance property and temperature sensor to measure the temperature of surrounding which works by the fact that for every one degree celsius the voltage will increase 10mV and ambient light sensor to measure the light intensity  and convert it into electric signal (ie bright light = more current).
        using these analog data from sensors. I will set some condition and give digital signal to output motor (which runs when needed and ensure maintained humidity in soil for plants)


FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
    ðŸ”¹WiFi/Bluetooth Module: Monitor and control remotely (ESP8266 or HC-05).
    ðŸ”¹Rain Sensor: Skip watering if its already raining.
    ðŸ”¹Water Level Sensor: Alert if the water tank is low.
    ðŸ”¹RTC Module: Schedule watering times intelligently.
    ðŸ”¹Solar Panel: Make it eco-friendly!
    ðŸ”¹Make everything controlled and observing using mobile app.
