A Smart Meal Planning & Feedback System

Core Idea:
A simple web-based app to:

      Display menu in advance for informed choices and Let students opt-in/out for meals ahead of time.
            To make everyone satisfied by the generalized, most probable answers which can be seen by the head and chef as bar graph using data analysis.

      Rate meals and give quick feedback in the app.
            so scanning the qr, which then will be stored in database is waste of time, defenitely no one wants to see that , so we can make up the databasse into a
            SUMMARIZED message for the head and chef...
      
      Create reports for the mess manager to adjust meal prep and track food wastage.
            By the datas we got above , we can guess how much we can prepare and by tracking the wastage we can find our loss , most importantly used to reduce same mistake again.
            like by then wastage they get in a particular food so we can reduce that amount like that

Innovation's use:
      Uses data to reduce wastage and costs.
      
      Empowers students to be heard.

      Improves hygiene and satisfaction.
      
      Can work with just a Google Form + dashboard for MVP.

Future updates possible if idea arise...
