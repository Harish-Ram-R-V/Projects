SECURITY ALARM SYSTEM:

My Project Comprises of,
        ðŸ’ The fire and gas detection system is a smart safety solution designed to detect gas leaks (e.g., methane, CO, propane) and fire hazards (sudden temperature spikes).
        When a hazard is detected, the system triggers an alarm, activates LED indicators, and displays warnings buzzer sound.
        ðŸ’ The Theif Detection System can be used for safety purpose in Authorized Area Zones which works in base of laser detection.

HOW TO MAKE?
        I have used LDR(Light Emitting Diode) sensor to detect the presence of eternal light signal on it which works in base fact that ( more light -> more intensity -> more energy -> more production of valence electron -> lesser resistance) and temperature sensor to detect obnormality in temperature and gas sensor to measure harmful gas/smoke which works in fact that (low voltage -> less gas) but basiclally it has a sensitive material (tin dioxide) whose electrical resistance changes when it comes into contact with specific gas molecules ( like LPG, CO, etc.,)
        I will get data from these sensors and indicate the presence of fire or detection of theif , when temp&gas increases and light absence in ldr respectively.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:

ðŸ”¹ Connect to Wi-Fi (ESP8266/NodeMCU) â†’ Send alerts to a mobile app
ðŸ”¹ Add an SMS alert system (GSM Module) â†’ Notify users via text message
ðŸ”¹ Integrate with smart home systems for automated safety actions
ðŸ”¹ A relay module can be used to automatically cut off power supply or activate an exhaust fan to reduce danger.
ðŸ”¹ SO on...
